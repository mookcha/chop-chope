We need to set up the Ultrasonic sensors and Raspberry Pi inorder to do the demo. <br>
Please contact our team for live demo. :) 

-----------------------------------------------

Apart from this sensor demo, you may find other exploritory code in the repo as follow 

- Booking System : 
We have decided to pivot from this use case based on the findings from field research and interviews. However we decided to keep the working code in the repo, since there is a possibility and we will revisit this usecase in the future. 

- Signapore Hawker Center Visualization : 
(test-map.html) This part is to visualize the poppularity of all hawker centers in singapore on the map. It is in our product backlog, but we havn't finished the whole page.  We plan to get the data from https://data.gov.sg/dataset/hawker-centres 

- D3 Dashboard :
We explore D3.js to help visualize the seat availability data (dashboard.html) 
The current page is using mock data.   https://chop-chope.herokuapp.com/dashboard
